										<h2 class="major">Scheduler</h2>
										<p>It used to be very difficult and frustrating to access my university schedule. That is because all of the lectures, seminars and labs are put together on the same page for all groups. That is why I made this app. Using local storage (SQL) I am easily able to visualize only my classes in a simple way, even while offline. All of that can be done from my Android phone.</p>
